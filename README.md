# Bharat Internship Projects

Welcome to my Bharat Internship repository! Here, you'll find the projects I've completed during my internship, showcasing my skills in data science and Python.

## Projects:

### 1. Dog and Cat Image Classifier:

- **Objective**: Develop an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.
- **Key Highlights**:
  - Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers for image classification.
  - Leveraged Keras to streamline model development and training, stepping into the world of deep learning for the first time.
- **Files**:
  - `Dog and Cat Classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the Dog and Cat Image Classifier.
  - `Image Classification CNN Keras Dataset/dog_cat_images/`: Directory containing images of cats and dogs for training and testing.
- **Instructions**: Open `Dog and Cat Classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to explore the code and results.

### 2. Titanic Classification:

- **Objective**: Build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic.
- **Key Highlights**:
  - Employed logistic regression to construct a predictive model for survival probability.
  - Analyzed crucial factors affecting survival probabilities, such as passenger class, age, and gender.
- **Files**:
  - `titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the Titanic classification model.
  - `titanic.csv`: CSV file containing the Titanic dataset.
- **Instructions**: Open `titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to explore the code and results.

### 3. SMS Classifier:

- **Objective**: Develop a text classification model to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam.
- **Key Techniques Explored**:
  - TF-IDF: Utilized Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency for effective text analysis.
  - Multi-Nomial Naive Bayes: Employed this classifier for efficient SMS categorization.
- **Files**:
  - `Spam_SMS_Classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the SMS classifier.
  - `spam.csv`: CSV file containing the SMS dataset.
- **Instructions**: Open `Spam_SMS_Classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to explore the code and results.
