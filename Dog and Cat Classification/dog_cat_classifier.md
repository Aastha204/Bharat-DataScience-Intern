# Dog and Cat Image Classifier

Welcome to the Dog and Cat Image Classifier project! In this project, I've developed an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

## Key Highlights:

- **Objective**: Develop an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.
- **Techniques Used**: Data Science techniques in Python including CNN architecture, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D layers, and Keras.
- **Files**:
  - `Dog and Cat classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the Dog and Cat Image Classifier.
  - `Image Classification CNN Keras Dataset/dog_cat_images`: Directory containing images of cats and dogs for training and testing.
- **Instructions**: Open `Dog and Cat classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to explore the code and results.
- **Analysis**:
  - Implemented a CNN architecture utilizing Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers for image classification.
  - Leveraged Keras to streamline model development and training, stepping into the world of deep learning for the first time.

Feel free to explore the code and results in the provided Jupyter notebook. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.
