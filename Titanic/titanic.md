# Titanic Classification

Welcome to the Titanic Classification project! In this project, I've built a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic.

## Key Highlights:

- **Objective**: Build a predictive model using logistic regression to determine survival probabilities.
- **Techniques Used**: Data Science techniques in Python including data preprocessing, logistic regression, and feature analysis.
- **Files**:
  - `titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the Titanic classification model.
  - `titanic.csv`: CSV file containing the Titanic dataset.
- **Instructions**: Open `titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to explore the code and results.
- **Analysis**:
  - Utilized logistic regression to construct a predictive model for survival probability.
  - Analyzed crucial factors affecting survival probabilities, such as passenger class, age, and gender.

Feel free to explore the code and results in the provided Jupyter notebook. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.
